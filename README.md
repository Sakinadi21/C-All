## 💻 How to Run

You can compile and run the C files using any C compiler. Here's how to do it using `gcc`:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.c` file.
3. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o outputname
````

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./outputname
   ```

Alternatively, you can open the files in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like **Visual Studio Code**, **Code::Blocks**, or **CLion** and run them directly from there.

## 🧠 Sample Code

Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of arrays in C:

```c
// 1to10.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        arr[i] = i + 1;
        printf("Element %d: %d\n", i, arr[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
